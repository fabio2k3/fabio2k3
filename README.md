## 🔷 About Me
I am a highly motivated 3rd-year Computer Science student at the University of Havana (MATCOM).  
I enjoy building real-world software solutions, exploring different programming paradigms, and continuously improving my technical skills.

I have worked on projects ranging from game development and web applications to interpreters, lightweight antivirus systems, and small-scale artificial intelligence experiments. I have also collaborated with the Artificial Intelligence research group at MATCOM.

I value clean code, solid fundamentals, and learning through practice.
